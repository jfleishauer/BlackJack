# Black Jack Demo
Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. My name is Jaime Fleishauer, and I am a recent graduate. 
I create this game of Black Jack as my final for my Java 2 class. 
There are multiple files here as part of the assignment. We were to create an API, a demo and template for a CIT-111 student to work on to learn more about programming.
There is also a folder of images for the cards in order for the game to work.

Enjoy!
